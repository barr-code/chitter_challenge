Week 4 challenge at Makers Academy: build a working Twitter clone called Chitter.
Users sign iup with their email, password, username, and name. Username and email
must be unique in the database. Peeps (posts to Chitter) display name and username
of the user. You don't have to be logged in to see peeps, but you must log in to post a peep.

Written in Ruby with Postgres database. Capybara/Rspec testing.
